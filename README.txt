Web UI for Serviio
Front End for Serviio

Requirements: HTTP server, PHP5 (with XML simple and cURL), JavaScript-enabled web browser.
Serviio 0.6.1 or higher required.

This app was originally written by acidumirae@gmail.com and kudos goes to his work.
My goal is to keep the development of Web UI active and to continue to improve the application.

TODO:
- better error management
- maybe some controls (start/stop) of the status refreshes
- better notification of when new version of Web UI and Serviio exist

CHANGELOG:
- 1.0 - 3/1/2012 - Release of new version
