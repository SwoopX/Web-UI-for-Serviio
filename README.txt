Web UI for Serviio v0.6.1
Front End for Serviio

Requirements: HTTP server, PHP5 (with XML simple and cURL), JavaScript-enabled web browser.
Serviio 0.6.1 or higher required.

This app was originally written by acidumirae@gmail.com and kudos goes to his work.
My goal is to simply make his app better and keep it updated with newer releases of Serviio.

TODO:
- alter how error messages display
- flag in status bar to show if new Serviio version exists
- maybe some controls (start/stop) of the status refreshes
- add growl for notifications
- transcoding button - change to other folder tree app
- remove afb folder
- Start/Stop doesn't work
- Presentation UI rework
- check at startup if new version of WebUI exists
- check at startup if new version of Serviio exists - display growl


CHANGELOG:
- 0.6.1 - patched code by Mark Pemberton <mpemberton5@gmail.com> to work with 0.6.1 changes.
