Web UI for Serviio v0.6.1
Front End for Serviio

Requirements: HTTP server, PHP5 (with XML simple and cURL), JavaScript-enabled web browser.
Serviio 0.6.1 or higher required.

This app was originally written by acidumirae@gmail.com and kudos goes to his work.
My goal is to simply make his app better and keep it updated with newer releases of Serviio.

TODO:
- Work on Show status option
- Change Online Sources to a tab
- Change Online Sources type from checkbox to radio buttons
- Suggestions?

CHANGELOG:
- 0.6.1 - patched code by Mark Pemberton <mpemberton5@gmail.com> to work with 0.6.1 changes.
