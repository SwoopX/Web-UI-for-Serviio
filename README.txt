Web UI for Serviio
Front End for Serviio

Requirements: HTTP server, PHP5 (with XML simple and cURL), JavaScript-enabled web browser.

This app was originally written by acidumirae@gmail.com and kudos goes to his work.
My goal is to keep the development of Web UI active and to continue to improve the application.

TODO:
- alter how error messages display
- maybe some controls (start/stop) of the status refreshes
- add growl for notifications - maybe for saving? unsure
- transcoding button - change to other folder tree app
- remove afb folder
- Presentation UI rework
- check at startup if new version of WebUI exists
- check at startup if new version of Serviio exists - display growl


CHANGELOG:
- 1.0 - 3/1/2012 - Release of new version
